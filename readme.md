### Project Synopsis

The intelligent Safe as a Vault ( iSaaV ) software system is designed to track goods shipments being transported in vehicular, rail, aircraft, and/or ship conveyances both within and across national borders, such as US-Mexico and US-Canada. The primary focus of iSaaV is on security and efficiency using GPS devices and censors to monitor the path and time taken by each shipment as it moves from waypoint to waypoint from origin to destination. Analyzing the GPS and sensor data received in combination with a virtual model of the shipment context that includes both geofenced terrain and comprehensive stakeholder, goods and operational information, iSaaV automatically detects anomalies that may either separately or cumulatively indicate security breaches, risks, and/or inefficiencies.
